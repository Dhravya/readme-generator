![Readme Generator](https://us-east-1.tixte.net/uploads/img.dhravya.dev/l0ap2hcs50a.png)

What it does:
- Run the command in your project's directory
- it will ask a few questions
- You answer the questions 
- It will generate a README for you, and will also add auto-generated installation and usage instructions

You can then edit the README yourself as you like!

### Installation

If you want to use it, (and not bother with code), use this command:

```
cargo install readme-generator
```

If you don't have cargo, you can download the [latest release](https://github.com/Dhravya/readme-generator/releases)
This isn't recommended, because it won't be registered as a binary and you'll have to run the exe file

For contributing:

```
git clone https://github.com/Dhravya/readme-generator.git
cd Readme Generator
cargo install
```

### Usage
windows:
```
readme-generator.exe
```
Linux:
```
#give it permission to run
chmod +x readme-generator
#run it
readme-generator

```
Mac:

coming soon

Then all you have to do is fill a form!

Normally, you'd run `cargo run` but that isn't needed because i've published to crates.io
you can run `cargo build` to build the project for your os with rust compiler(You must have the source files)
